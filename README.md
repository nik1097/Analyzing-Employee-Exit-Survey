# Analyzing-Employee-Exit-Survey
We've worked with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. We have analysed the data and tried to derive insightful insights into the dataset.

Aim

In this project, we'll try to know the following:

Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
We will combine the results from both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers.
